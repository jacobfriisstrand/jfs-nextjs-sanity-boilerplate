# Sanity rules

- You can NEVER change or alter the code in [types.ts](mdc:src/sanity/types.ts). This file is autogenerated by Sanity when running npm run typegen or npm run dev

- When working with Sanity, you can use the Sanity CLI to search and read documentation. Use `npx sanity docs search "search term"` to find relevant documentation articles, and `npx sanity docs read the-docs-slug` to read specific documentation. This is especially useful when planning implementations, migrations, or when you need to understand Sanity features. Always search for relevant docs first before implementing solutions.
